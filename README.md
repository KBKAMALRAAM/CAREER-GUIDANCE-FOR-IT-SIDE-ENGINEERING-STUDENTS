Project Title: CAREER GUIDANCE FOR IT SIDE ENGINEERING STUDENTS
Abstract:

The Information Technology (IT) sector is characterized by rapid technological disruption, demanding that engineering students continuously adapt to evolving skill sets such as Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, and Full-Stack Development. However, generic career guidance platforms often dilute their value by aggregating unrelated engineering disciplines, leading to information overload for aspiring software professionals.

"CAREER GUIDANCE FOR IT SIDE ENGINEERING STUDENTS" is a specialized web-based ecosystem designed exclusively for students in computing-centric branches, including Computer Science (CSE), Information Technology (IT), Artificial Intelligence & Data Science (AI&DS), and Cyber Security.

Unlike broad-spectrum career portals, this platform implements a "Domain-Locked Architecture", ensuring that users are exposed solely to resources relevant to the software industry. Key features include dynamic skill-gap analysis for coding roles, curated learning paths for specific tech stacks (e.g., MERN, Python/Django), and a peer community for hosting hackathons and coding challenges. By filtering out non-IT distractions and leveraging AI to recommend niche technical certifications, the platform provides a streamlined, high-efficiency pathway for students to transition from academia to competitive roles in the tech industry.

Key Highlights:
Target Audience: Exclusive to B.E./B.Tech students in CSE, IT, AI&DS, AI&ML, and CS-Specializations.

Core Problem: Eliminates the "noise" of non-IT jobs (e.g., core manufacturing or construction roles) to focus purely on software and tech.

Key Features:

Tech-Stack Roadmaps: Step-by-step guides for Web Dev, App Dev, and AI.

Coding-Centric Community: A feed dedicated to GitHub repositories, LeetCode streaks, and Hackathon team formations.

AI Resource Matching: Smart suggestions for tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or TensorFlow based on the user's current learning phase
